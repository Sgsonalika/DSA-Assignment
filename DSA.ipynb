    "1 DIscuss string slicing and provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "String slicing is a technique in programming that allows you to extract a specific portion or \"slice\" of a string. Imagine a string as a sequence of characters, each with a position or index, starting from 0 for the first character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for slicing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "\n",
    "i. start: The index where the slice starts (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. stop: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. step: (Optional) The interval between characters in the slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Simple Slice:\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[0:5:1]) # Output: Hello\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Omitting Start or Stop:\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[:5]) # Output: Hello\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[7:]) # Output: World!\n",
    "\n",
    "text[:5] starts from the beginning and goes up to index 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "text[7:] starts from index 7 and goes to the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Using Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[::2]) # Output: Hlo ol!\n",
    "\n",
    "text[::2] means \"take every second character\" starting from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Negative Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[-6:-1]) # Output: World\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative indices count from the end of the string. So text[-6:-1] starts at the 6th character from the end and goes up to (but not including) the last character.\n",
    "\n",
    "5 Reversing a String:\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(text[::-1]) # Output: !dlroW ,olleH\n",
    "\n",
    "The slice text[::-1] reverses the string by starting from the end and moving backward with a step of -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "If start is omitted, slicing starts from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "If stop is omitted, slicing continues to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The step is optional, and if omitted, the default is 1 (every character).\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes string slicing a powerful tool for extracting specific parts of a string or manipulating it in various ways."

    "2 Explain the key features of lists in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists in Python are a versatile and powerful data structure that allows you to store and manipulate a collection of items. Here are the key features of lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Ordered Collection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Lists maintain the order of elements. The first item added to the list will be at the first position, the second item at the second position, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fruits[0]) # Output: apple\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Mutable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after they are created. You can add, remove, or modify elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits[1] = \"blueberry\" # Change \"banana\" to \"blueberry\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fruits) # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Heterogeneous Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: A list can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "mixed_list = [1, \"Hello\", 3.14, [5, 6]]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(mixed_list) # Output: [1, 'Hello', 3.14, [5, 6]]\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Dynamic Size:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Lists in Python can grow or shrink in size. You can add or remove elements without worrying about declaring the size of the list in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers.append(4) # Add an element\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers.remove(2) # Remove an element\n",
    "\n",
    "print(numbers) # Output: [1, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Slicing and Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: You can access individual elements or a range of elements in a list using indexing and slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n",
    "\n",
    "print(letters[1:4]) # Output: ['b', 'c', 'd']\n",
    "\n",
    "vi. Built-in Functions and Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Python provides many built-in functions and methods to manipulate lists, such as len(), append(), pop(), sort(), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"cherry\", \"banana\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits.sort() # Sort the list\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fruits) # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "\n",
    "vii. List Comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Python allows you to create new lists by applying an expression to each element of an existing list using a concise syntax known as list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(squares) # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "\n",
    "viii. Supports Nesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Lists can contain other lists as elements, allowing for the creation of complex data structures like matrices or lists of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(matrix[1][2]) # Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "ix. Iterability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: You can easily iterate over the elements of a list using loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fruit) #Output:\n",
    "             \n",

    "iii. Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: Preferred when you need a collection that may change over time, such as adding or removing items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples: Used when you need a collection that should not change, such as storing a fixed set of values like coordinates, or when you want to ensure the data remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",

    "\n",
    "iv. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: Have more built-in methods like append(), remove(), pop(), sort(), etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "v.Nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists: Can be nested inside other lists, and you can also nest tuples inside lists.\n",
    "\n",

    "5 Describe the key features of sets and provide examples of their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are commonly used when you need to store a collection of items but want to ensure that there are no duplicates. Here are the key features of sets along with examples of their use:\n",
    "\n",
    "i Unordered Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Sets do not maintain any order of elements. The items in a set are stored in a way that makes them efficient for membership tests (checking whether an item is in the set).\n",

    "\n",
    "fruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fruits) # Output might be: {'cherry', 'banana', 'apple'}\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Unique Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. If you add a duplicate element to a set, it will only appear once.\n",

    "iii. Mutable\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Sets are mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after the set has been created.\n",

    "fruits.add(\"cherry\") # Adding an element\n",
    "\n",
    "print(fruits) # Output: {'banana', 'cherry', 'apple'}\n",

    "iv. No Indexing or Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Since sets are unordered, you cannot access elements by index or slice them like you can with lists or tuples.\n",

    "ii. Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Since tuples are immutable, they are used to ensure that data remains unchanged. This is useful when you want to protect the integrity of data passed between different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_user_info():\n",
    "\n",
    "return (\"Alice\", 30, \"Engineer\")  # Returning fixed information about a user\n",
    "name, age, profession = get_user_info()\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Dictionary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable (unlike lists). This is useful when you need to use composite keys or create a mapping with fixed key values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "coordinates = {(40.7128, -74.0060): \"New York City\", (34.0522, -118.2437): \"Los Angeles\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(coordinates[(40.7128, -74.0060)]) # Output: New York City\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Multiple Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Functions often return multiple values using tuples. This allows you to return a fixed number of related items without having to create a custom data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "\n",
    "quotient = a // b\n",
    "\n",
    "remainder = a % b\n",
    "\n",
    "return quotient, remainder\n",
    "q, r = divide(10, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(q, r) # Output: 3 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "i. 1. Unique Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets are ideal for situations where you need to store a collection of unique items. They automatically eliminate duplicates, making them useful for removing duplicates from a list or ensuring that only unique items are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(unique_numbers) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Membership Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets are highly efficient for membership testing due to their underlying hash table implementation. This makes them useful for scenarios where you need to quickly check if an item exists in a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "allowed_users = {\"alice\", \"bob\", \"charlie\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"alice\" in allowed_users) # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"dave\" in allowed_users) # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Set Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets support mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. These operations are useful for comparing and combining sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "union_set = set1 | set2 # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "intersection_set = set1 & set2 # {3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "difference_set = set1 - set2 # {1, 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "symmetric_diff_set = set1 ^ set2 # {1, 2, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Union:\", union_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Intersection:\", intersection_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Difference:\", difference_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Symmetric Difference:\", symmetric_diff_set)\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Data Deduplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Sets can be used to remove duplicates from lists or other collections quickly. This is useful when you need to clean up data or ensure that a collection contains only unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "names = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Alice\", \"Charlie\", \"Bob\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "unique_names = set(names)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(unique_names) # Output: {'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'}\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Frozensets for Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: If you need a set-like data structure that is immutable, use frozenset. This is useful when you need to use sets as dictionary keys or when you want to ensure that the set cannot be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "\n",
    "#frozen_set.add(5) # This will raise an error\n",
    "\n",
    "print(frozen_set) # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})"

    "i. Adding Items\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary by assigning a value to a new key.\n",

    "8 Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the keys of a dictionary must be immutable. This is because dictionary keys are used to generate hash values, which are then used to quickly retrieve the corresponding values. If a key were mutable, its hash value could change after it was added to the dictionary, which would make it impossible to find the key later, leading to inconsistencies and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Immutable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashability: The primary reason dictionary keys need to be immutable is that they must be hashable. The hash function is used to determine the index at which the value associated with a particular key is stored. Immutable objects have a fixed hash value, which ensures that the key can be reliably found in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: If keys were mutable, changing a key after it was added to a dictionary would lead to the dictionary becoming inconsistent. For instance, the key could no longer be located, and the integrity of the data structure would be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance: The immutability of keys contributes to the efficiency of dictionary operations like lookups, insertions, and deletions. Since the hash value of a key remains constant, these operations can be performed in average O(1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Strings:\n",

    "Strings are immutable in Python, so they are commonly used as dictionary keys\n",
